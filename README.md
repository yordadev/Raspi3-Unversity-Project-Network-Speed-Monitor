I had to do a [raspi3](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) course project for one of my programming classes. This will run on anything that has python on it and will store your speeds every x minutes to google drive as well as tweet to @yourispprovider on twitter when the speeds are below x of what you are paying for.
